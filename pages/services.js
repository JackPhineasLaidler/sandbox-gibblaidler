                            <p>Following the successful outcomes which we achieved when with assisting with tender management projects, our clients often returned for advice and assistance with insurance and risk issues.  In response to this demand, we created a retained service package that gives you full access to our specialist knowledge, additional bespoke services (see below), and full support with future renewals.</p>
                            <p>The vast majority of our tender clients go on to reap the benefits of accessing the skills and experience of Gibbs Laidler on a long term retained basis, with some client relationships lasting for over a decade.
